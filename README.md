## What this program does
This program is a recreation in python of the original 1971 text based adventure "Oregon Trail" developed in BASIC.
some elements of the 1990's version have been included as well. It simulates a journey across the western United States,
with many perils along the way. Some of your party members may not survive, and if you aren't too careful, you too
won't make it to Oregon City...

## What is different from other programs of similar nature?
Many have attempted to recreate the original game in a more modern programming language, however, none have come close to
the level of completeness I have achieved in my recreation. Many fall short of the features and events the original BASIC
version of the game included. I do not claim to feature everything from the original game, yet it is still the most feature
rich recreation yet.

## Who is the target audience?
Those who have played the original and want to get the nostalgia of dying of cholera once again, but on a more modern
computer. Those who like RPGs and adventure games will also love it.
